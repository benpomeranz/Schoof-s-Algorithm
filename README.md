# Schoof's-Algorithm
This repository includes my paper on Schoof's Algorithm, completed under Professor Vogt in Math 1580. It dives into Schoof's algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves over finite fields, and includes a python file to assess whether a given elliptic curve is of even order. This gives the general idea of the algorithm, sans some complexity; in the full algorithm, we find the order of the group modulo 2 (i.e is it odd or even?), and then modulo 3, and so on for greater primes, until we can ascertain the order of the group overall using the Sunzi Remainder Theorem. The modulo 2 case is much less complex than for larger primes, and you can read more about this in the paper. 

EvenCurves.py takes 3 arguments (A_range, b_range, q_range) runs the aforementioned simplified algorithm on all elliptic curves of the form $Y^2=x^3+Ax+B$ over finite field $F_q$ for integers $A$ in range $(1, A_range)$, et cetera. It then yields what proportion of these curves have even order, and visualizes this in a graph.
